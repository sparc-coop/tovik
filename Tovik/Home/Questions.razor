		{ "What is Tovik?", "Tovik is a website plugin that instantly translates your website into 130+ languages and 600+ dialects with a simple one-time installation." },
		{ "Why Tovik?", "Other translation tools expect the site visitors to do the translation and they shouldn’t have to. Tovik automatically translates your site for every visitor in their preferred language." },
		{ "How does it work?", "Tovik detects a visitor’s language from their browser and translates your content instantly. Translations are then saved for future visitors." },
		{ "Do I need to know how to code?", "Nope! Tovik has plug-and-play support for WordPress, Wix, Webflow, Weebly, SquareSpace, and Shopify. Or just drop one line of HTML into your site, and you're done." },
		{ "How do I install it?", "Download the plugin for your platform, or copy the line of HTML into your website. Click the Start Free button at the top of this page to see the installation instructions." },
		{ "Will Tovik work with my site?", "If you can add a plugin or a line of HTML, Tovik works. This includes most CMS platforms." },
		{ "How many languages will Tovik translate my website to?", "Over 130 languages and 600+ dialects covering all major languages and most of the world!" },
		{ "Do you track user or visitor data?", "Nope! We only keep track of how many pages you’ve translated. Your visitors’ data stays private in their browser and we never use, track, or store their data." },
		{ "What does Tovik include?", "Tovik Free includes up to 20 pages per domain. Tovik Pro includes up to 500 translated pages per domain. Both have unlimited aliases, page views, languages, and bandwidth. No subscription and no hidden fees." },
		{ "So there’s no subscription fee?", "Nope! Tovik is a one-time purchase. We are proud to have created a translation engine that requires no subscriptions, no recurring charges, and no surprises." },
		{ "Can I use Tovik on multiple domains?", "Yes, for aliases of your purchased domain. Non-aliased domains will require a separate purchase." },
		{ "What if I have more than 500 pages of content?", "No problem! We track usage to ensure everyone is using Tovik fairly. We’ll reach out if needed, but we’ll never stop your service without getting in touch." },
		{ "Can I get a refund if Tovik doesn't work for my site?", "Absolutely. Send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:support@sparc.coop\">support@sparc.coop</a> and we’ll refund your purchase right away." },
		{ "How do I get support?", "You can always email us at <a href=\"mailto:support@sparc.coop\">support@sparc.coop</a>. We’re here to help with anything you may need." }
